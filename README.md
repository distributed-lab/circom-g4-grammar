# Circom G4 Grammar Spec

## Playing Around

If you would like to try it out, first go to [antlr.org](https://www.antlr.org/download.html) and download the latest **complete** version. 
Do not forget to modify the Makefile afterward.

Then, after you generate the bindings with the __make__ command, you can compile it with the Java compiler and use the 
commands mentioned in the docs to play around with the grammar: [Getting Started with ANTLR v4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/dev/doc/getting-started.md).
